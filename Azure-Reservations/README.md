Azure Reservation is the process of saving roughly up to 72% on compute resources compared to the pay as you go rate. This allos you to save a substantial amount of money if you have a specified that you will use within a certain period of time.

For this Lab I have chosen to use an SQL Database as my resource(the reasoning being I have never interacted with this reosurce before and so I am using this to provide exposure to this useful resource)

Using the pricing calculator provided by Azure.Below shows how much it would cost with Pay as you go rates

This then saves £500 for the month if 3 years were reserved

This looks like a lof money upfront but, this is a standard SQL database limit.
